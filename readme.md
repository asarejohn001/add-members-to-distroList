# Distribution Group
Distribution groups are used for sending notifications to a group of people. They can receive external email if enabled by the administrator.
Distribution groups are best for situations where you need to broadcast information to a set group of people, such as "People in Building A" or "Everyone at Contoso.". Learn more about distribution group [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/compare-groups?view=o365-worldwide#distribution-groups).
